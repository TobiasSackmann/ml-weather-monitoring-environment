# DAG Subfolder

This folder contains all Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) as well as all files used by the DAGs, that will be present in the Apache Airflow deployment.

A Dag is the way Tasks are organized within Apache Airflow as explained in the respective [documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/dags.html).
